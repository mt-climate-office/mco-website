The Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes (CSKT) and the Montana Climate Office (MCO) are excited to announce the launch of the CSKT PurpleAir Air Quality Sensor Network, an integral part of the *Native Drought Resilience* project. This initiative is a collaborative effort between the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes (CSKT) of the Flathead Reservation, Salish Kootenai College, the Montana Climate Office at the University of Montana, and The Wilderness Society. Funded by [NOAA’s National Integrated Drought Information System](https://www.drought.gov){target="_blank"}, the Native Drought Resilience project aims to enhance health, resilience, and education across the Flathead Reservation.

## Project Overview

The *Native Drought Resilience* project is implementing several actions outlined in the updated [CSKT Climate Change Strategic Plan](http://csktclimate.org/index.php/resources/ongoing-work/){target="_blank"}. A key component is the installation and maintenance of a network of low-cost PurpleAir air quality sensors throughout the Flathead Reservation. [PurpleAir](https://www2.purpleair.com){target="_blank"} monitors are WiFi-enabled sensors that continuously measure fine particle pollution (PM2.5), offering a local view of wildfire smoke, air pollution, and potential health impacts.

This network builds upon previous PurpleAir sensor deployments funded by [*Montana Health Professionals for a Healthy Climate* (MontanaHPHC)](https://www.montanahphc.org){target="_blank"} and the [*Montana Department of Environmental Quality* (DEQ)](https://deq.mt.gov){target="_blank"}. With NIDIS funding, the CSKT PurpleAir Air Quality Monitoring Network has installed sensors both indoors and outdoors at essential community locations, including schools, health centers, and Tribal government offices.

Flathead Reservation residents can use these sensors for real-time health and safety assessments, while educators can incorporate air quality data into [environmental science and health curricula](https://native-climate.com/education/){target="_blank"}.

## Real-Time Monitoring

Access the real-time PurpleAir sensor data on an interactive map at the following link: <https://climate.umt.edu/cskt-air-quality/>{target="_blank"}. Data from the CSKT Air Quality network are also available on the [AirNow Fire and Smoke Map](https://fire.airnow.gov){target="_blank"}.

## Instrumentation

The [**PurpleAir Zen**](https://www2.purpleair.com/products/purpleair-zen/){target="_blank"} measures real-time PM2.5 levels and features a full-color LED for instant air quality indication. Built-in WiFi allows data transmission to the real-time [PurpleAir Map](https://map.purpleair.com){target="_blank"}, accessible via any smart device. For areas with limited WiFi, the Zen includes a real-time clock and SD card capabilities for data storage. The monitor features replaceable PMS6003 laser counters and an expansion port for future upgrades. More information about the technology used in PurpleAir sensors is available on the [PurpleAir website](https://www2.purpleair.com/pages/technology/){target="_blank"}.

## Background

The Confederated Salish & Kootenai Tribes (CSKT) of the Flathead Reservation were pioneers in drafting a [Climate Change Strategic Plan](http://csktclimate.org/downloads/Climate%20Change%20Strategic%20Plan/CSKT%20Climate%20Change%20Adaptation%20Plan%204.14.16.pdf){target="_blank"} in 2013, updated in 2016. This plan emphasizes understanding drought impacts on forests, water and air quality, and critical resources while developing a drought management plan.

In 2020, the CSKT Climate Change Advisory Committee (CCAC) began developing the CSKT Climate Change Adaptation Plan (CCAP). This "living" plan outlines climate impacts and resilience actions that the tribes are undertaking to mitigate these effects. CSKT climate resilience efforts blend traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) with Western scientific understanding to address climate challenges such as drought, wildfires, and extreme weather.

The CSKT Climate Change Strategic Plan and Adaptation Plan have received support from The Wilderness Society, Crown Managers Partnership [Hi5 Working Group](https://www.crownmanagers.org/five-needle-pine-working-group/){target="_blank"}, [Native Waters on Arid Lands](https://nativewaters-aridlands.com){target="_blank"}, and the [Montana Climate Office](https://climate.umt.edu){target="_blank"}. Implementation actions are funded through individual CSKT departments, including Natural Resources, Forestry, Housing, and Cultural Preservation.

## Council Approval

The CSKT Tribal Council approved the installation of PurpleAir monitors as part of the *Native Drought Resilience* project on [August 17, 2023](https://www.csktribes.org/index.php/component/rsfiles/download?path=Tribal+Council%2FMinutes%2F2023%2FAug%2F081723+Minutes.pdf&Itemid=101){target="_blank"}.
