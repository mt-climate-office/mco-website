<h2 id="overview-of-growing-degree-days">Overview of Growing Degree Days</h2>
<p>For most plants, phenological development is strongly related to the accumulation of heat or temperature units above a threshold or base temperature below which little growth occurs. This lower threshold temperature varies with plant species. In some plants there is also an upper threshold temperature above which little or no growth occurs. Although temperature is the most important factor controlling the rate of plant development, other factors such as water and light availability and daylight length may modify its effects.</p>

<p>The most common temperature index used to estimate plant development is growing degree days (GDD) which are calculated from the daily maximum and minimum air temperature. Growing degree days have proven useful for scientists, crop consultants, and producers who use them to predict plant development rate and growth stage. In certain crops this information is used to help plan crop management decisions such as irrigation or pesticide application timing, and for scheduling harvest.</p>

<p>Daily GDDs are calculated as follows. If there are low or high cutoff temperature thresholds for a given crop, the daily minumum ($T_{min}$) and maximum ($T_{max}$) temperature are clipped to that range. For example, if the low cutoff temperature is 35°F, the high cutoff is 80°F, $T_{min}$ is 32°F, and $T_{max}$ is 82°F, $T_{min}$ and $T_{max}$ would be set to 35°F and 80°F, respectively. Once the values are adjusted to the proper range, the daily average temperature  ($T_{avg}$) is calculated from the clipped daily $T_{min}$ and $T_{max}$:</p>

\[T_{avg} = (T_{min} + T_{max}) / 2\]

<p>Finally, the daily total GDD units are calculated by subtracting the minumum temperature threshold from $T_{avg}$:</p>

\[GDDs = T_{avg} - Minimum Threshold\]

<p>As the growing season progresses, GDDs are typically summed to help predict and monitor different crop growth stages.</p>

<h3 id="calculating-growth-stage">Calculating Growth Stage</h3>
<p><strong>This section’s text is adapted from the NDAWN <a href="https://ndawn.ndsu.nodak.edu/help-wheat-growing-degree-days.html">GDD help page</a>.</strong></p>

<p>Daily GDD’s calculated using the above conditions are accumulated for each day following planting to determine the current estimated Haun growth stage. The main uncertainty in this calculation occurs during the period from planting to emergence because of planting depth and varying seedbed conditions that affect soil temperature, especially soil water content, surface residue, and soil type. For the same planting depth and under the same climatic conditions, emergence in seedbeds with surface residue will be delayed by 1 to 2 days. Despite this uncertainty, growth stages are calculated based on planting date because it is more readily available in producers records.</p>

<p>When planted at 1.5 inches depth in a bare (no surface residue) moist soil, it takes an accumulation of between 180 and 250 GDD (°F) beginning with the day after planting until emergence occurs, depending on the crop. Emergence by this criteria means plants are visible in the row (you can see the rows), and the first leaf is equal to about one half of its eventual full length. By this criteria emergence is defined as Haun stage 0.5.</p>

<p>The Haun growth stage scale<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> is far more precise than other commonly used scales. The Haun scale assigns consecutive numbers to main stem leaves in the order in which they appear. When the first leaf is fully developed, the plant is at stage 1, and so on through stage 8. Each leaf is fully developed when the next leaf is visible in the rolled part of the leaf. For example, leaf 2 is fully developed when the third leaf is visible in the rolled par of leaf 1.</p>

<p>The number assigned to each stage can be further subdivided into fractional sub-stages to provide more information. Fractional leaf stages are determined by comparing the length of the developing leaf to the preceding leaf. For example, if leaf 3 is one-third as long as leaf 2 then the Haun growth stage is 2.3, and if leaf 3 is one-half as long as leaf 2 it is designated stage 2.5. The same type of system is also used to designate sub-stages in the growth units following stage 8.</p>

<p>While not all crops listed below use the Haun scale to track growth stages, other methods are similar in that they track the emergence of leaf numbers as the plants grow.</p>

<h2 id="barley-growing-degree-days">Barley Growing Degree Days</h2>

<p><strong>This section’s text is adapted from the NDAWN <a href="https://ndawn.ndsu.nodak.edu/help-barley-growing-degree-days.html">barley GDD help page</a>.</strong></p>

<p>Growth stages of barley can be determined by visual inspection any time, but an alternate method based on air temperature is available to estimate the current growth stage without going to the field. For most plants, phenological development from seeding to maturity is related to the accumulation of heat or temperature units above a threshold or base temperature below which no growth occurs. The lower threshold temperature varies with plant species. Bauer et al. (1992) showed that barley development could be estimated using this method.</p>

<h3 id="barley-growing-degree-day-calculation">Barley Growing Degree Day Calculation</h3>

<p>Temperature or heat units are called growing degree days (GDD) and are calculated by subtracting the lower threshold (base) temperature from the average daily air temperature. Although the lower growth limit for barley is about 42 °F, Bauer et al (1992) found better correlation between accumulated GDD and barley growth stage by defining the lower threshold temperature as 32 °F (0 °C)<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. This also makes conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit GDD’s much easier. Average daily air temperature is calculated by averaging the daily maximum and minimum air temperatures.</p>

<p>Several additional constraints on maximum and minimum temperature were introduced to eliminate very low or very high temperatures that retard or prevent growth of wheat<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup><sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. We have included those same temperature restrictions in the GDD calculations for barley because it’s so similar to wheat. They are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>If daily Max or daily Min Temp &lt; 32 °F (0 °C) it’s set equal to 32 °F (0 °C).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to Haun stage 2.0, (384 GDD accumulated since planting); If daily Max Temp &gt; 70 °F (21 °C) then it’s set equal to 70 °F (21 °C).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After Haun stage 2.0; If daily Max Temp &gt; 95 °F (35 °C) it’s set equal to 95 °F (35 °C).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Using these criteria, growing degree days can be mapped to Haun growth stages in the table below.</p>

<p><strong>This section’s text is adapted from the NDAWN <a href="https://ndawn.ndsu.nodak.edu/help-sugarbeet-growing-degree-days.html">sugarbeet GDD help page</a>.</strong></p>

<p>Holen (1998)<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>, and Holen and Dexter (1997)<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote">8</a></sup> showed that a lower threshold (base) temperature for sugarbeet development of 34 °F (1.1 °C) provided the best statistical results. They also found that no upper threshold was needed. However, their research was done during three relatively cool growing seasons, 1991-1993, when few high temperatures occurred. The average daily temperature exceeded 90 °F on 11 days in 1991, but in 1992 and 1993, the maximum temperature never reached 90 °F. This explains why the inclusion of a 90 °F maximum limit did not improve their model performance. However, others have reported that an upper limit of 86°F (30 °C) will provide better results. A base temperature of 34°F and an upper threshold temperature of 86°F are used by the MCO.</p>

<h3 id="sugarbeet-leaf-growth-characteristics-reprinted-from-holen-and-dexter">Sugarbeet Leaf Growth Characteristics (Reprinted from Holen and Dexter)</h3>
<p>Sugarbeet emerges from the soil with a pair of cotyledonary leaves. These leaves serve as a temporary source of food reserves for the developing seeding. The next leaves to emerge from the crown are the first two true leaves. Although these leaves appear as a pair and seem to be oppositely arranged, they are alternate and one of the leaves is developmentally behind the other. Stage separation between the first and second true leaves does not occur. Thereafter, all leaves emerge from the crown in an alternate pattern and are arranged in a 5/13 phyllotaxus. Phyllotaxus is a term used by botanists to describe the pattern of leaf emergence of a plant. A 5/13 arrangement means the leaves emerge from 13 vertical ranks around the crown and there are five turns around the crown as you follow leaf emergence before another leaf emerges in the same vertical rank.</p>

<p>Reasonable leaf stage predictions from GDD require that leaf stages of sugarbeet plants be correctly and uniformly identified. Staging sugarbeet is not difficult but a uniform system for designating stages has not been proposed in the sugarbeet growing regions of the United States. Sugarbeet is a unique crop as it is a biennial plant grown as an annual for its sucrose reserves. In the first year of growth it remains in a vegetative state and produces an indeterminate number of leaves. Under Belgium conditions (110 day growing season) sugarbeet produced an average of 40 leaves and under full canopy maintained an average of 25 leaves with new leaves replacing ones that died. Fortunately, it isn’t necessary or even useful to precisely know the sugarbeet leaf number beyond the eight- to ten-leaf stage when herbicide applications usually end because management decisions will not be improved by knowing crop leaf stage later in the season.</p>

<h3 id="proposed-sugarbeet-leaf-stage-system-reprinted-from-holen-and-dexter">Proposed Sugarbeet Leaf Stage System (Reprinted from Holen and Dexter)</h3>
<p>The following table is a proposed staging system for sugarbeet up to the nine-leaf stage. This staging method designates the leaf stages as vegetative stages V1.0 through V9.0. Leaves are counted when the leaf blade is fully unrolled. This system also uses decimal fractions of each leaf stage to allow better separation of leaf stages and increased accuracy of GDD predictions. The decimal fractions are used to represent the percentage or amount of the next emerging leaf that has unrolled. For example, if the plant has three fully unrolled leaves and the fourth leaf is approximately 60 percent unrolled the stage is V3.6. At later leaf stages, when several unrolled leaf initials may be present, use the most advanced leaf in the estimate. This staging method has at least one major deficiency. As crop development progresses beyond the V2.0 leaf stage, two or more developing leaf initials always are present. This means true V3.0 to V9.0 stages do not exist. For example, as the fifth-leaf fully unrolls, the sixth leaf initial is present and the earliest V5 stage is V5.1 or V5.2.</p>

<p>The division of each leaf stage into decimal fractions allows for more accurate predictions of plant development. For example, if a plant is correctly staged at V2.5 but you ignore the decimal fraction and call it a two-leaf plant or V2.0 there are 70 GDD of development not taken into account (141 GDD from V2.0 to V3.0 versus 70 GDD from V2.5 to V3.0).</p>

<p>The time from planting to emergence varies somewhat because of variations in planting depth and seedbed conditions that affect soil temperature, soil water content, surface residue, and soil type. Because of this variation the number of GDD required from planting until emergence is not constant which causes variation in estimated growth stages. Despite this uncertainty, growth stages on NDAWN are calculated based on planting date rather than emergence because planting date is more readily available in producers records.</p>

<p>The relationship between sunflower development and GDD is displayed in the table below. Growing degree days are accumulated beginning with the day after planting.<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote">9</a></sup> VE represents emergence. “The hypocotyl arch and cotyledons have emerged from the soil surface, and the first true leaf blade is less than 4 cm in length”.<sup id="fnref:9:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote">9</a></sup> V1, V2, V3 - V20 represent the number of true leaves at least 4 cm in length. “The criterion of not counting a leaf blade until it has attained a length of 4 cm does not represent a distinct physiological stage of leaf development.

<p>Although the lower growth limit for wheat is about 42°F, Bauer found better correlation in the GDD predictions by defining the lower threshold temperature as 32 °F (0 °C). This also makes conversion to °Celsius GDD’s much easier. We set an upper threshold temperature of 95°F. Several additional constraints on maximum and minimum temperature were introduced to eliminate very low and high temperatures that prevent or retard growth.<sup id="fnref:3:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup><sup id="fnref:4:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> They are:</p>
