    Laurie Yung is a Professor of Natural Resource Social Science 
    in the Department of Society and Conservation.  Her work focuses
    on how rural communities, agricultural producers, and federal 
    land management agencies respond to environmental change.  Yung
    is particularly interested in the relationship between science,
    practice, and policy, and how decision-makers handle scientific
    uncertainty.  Her current research examines the intersections
    between rural livelihoods, drought, and resource management.

    Kelsey Jencso is an Associate Professor of Hydrology and the Montana
    State Climatologist. His research focuses on forested mountain
    terrain and the factors that influence the redistribution of water,
    nutrients, and sediment across hillslopes and entire watersheds.
    Kelsey's current funded research focuses on the role of landscape
    topography for regulating forest productivity through differences
    in microclimate and plant available water. In his capacity as the
    Montana State Climatologist Dr. Jencso also places strong emphasis
    on bridging the gap between basic research in hydro-climatology
    and the extension of information to the public and managers for
    user specific decision making.

    Kyle Bocinsky is a research associate in the Montana Climate Office,
    and the climate science lead for the Montana Drought & Climate
    project. Kyle is a computational anthropologist interested in human
    responses to environmental change; climate change adaptation; and
    more generally how we can learn from the human past to plan for the
    future. Kyle's archaeological research has focused on the Ancestral
    Pueblo in the American Southwest. Kyle is leading the development of
    innovative climate information technologies for the MT Drought and
    Climate, including maps and figures for the MT Drought & Climate
    newsletters and website.

  bio: >- 
    Ada Smith is a PhD student in the Department of Society & Conservation
    working in the Human Dimensions Lab. Ada's research interests focus
    on agrarian values, decision-making and climate adaptation in Montana.
    She is particularly interested in understanding the ways in which
    producers experience, adapt, and respond to climate change in light of
    climate information, especially where there is a 'knowledge-action' gap.
    Ada has a background in community-based participatory research focused
    on Indigenous food sovereignty and decolonizing food systems education
    and is committed to research understanding how food systems connect and
    sustain both people and places.
