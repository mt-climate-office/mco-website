    "Despite the acceleration of climate change, erroneous assumptions of climate stationarity
    are still inculcated in the management of water resources in the United States (US). The
    US system for drought detection, which triggers billions of dollars in emergency resources,
    adheres to this assumption with preference towards 60-year (or longer) record lengths
    for drought characterization. Using observed data from 1,934 Global Historical Climate
    Network (GHCN) sites across the US, we show that conclusions based on long climate records
    can substantially bias assessment of drought severity. Bias emerges by assuming that
    conditions from the early and mid 20th century are as likely to occur in today's climate.
    Numerical simulations reveal that drought assessment error is relatively low with limited
    climatology lengths (~30 year) and that error increases with longer record lengths where
    climate is changing rapidly. We assert that non-stationarity in climate must be accounted
    for in contemporary assessments to more accurately portray present drought risk."

    "High frequency and spatially explicit irrigated land maps are important for understanding
    the patterns and impacts of consumptive water use by agriculture. We built annual, 30 m
    resolution irrigation maps using Google Earth Engine for the years 1986-2018 for 11 western
    states within the conterminous U.S. Our map classifies lands into four classes: irrigated
    agriculture, dryland agriculture, uncultivated land, and wetlands. We built an extensive
    geospatial database of land cover from each class, including over 50,000 human-verified
    irrigated fields, 38,000 dryland fields, and over 500,000 km<sup>2</sup> of uncultivated lands. We
    used 60,000 point samples from 28 years to extract Landsat satellite imagery, as well as
    climate, meteorology, and terrain data to train a Random Forest classifier. Using a
    spatially independent validation dataset of 40,000 points, we found our classifier has an
    overall binary classification (irrigated vs. unirrigated) accuracy of 97.8%, and a
    four-class overall accuracy of 90.8%. We compared our results to Census of Agriculture
    irrigation estimates over the seven years of available data and found good overall agreement
    between the 2832 county-level estimates (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.90), and high agreement when estimates are
    aggregated to the state level (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.94). We analyzed trends over the 33-year study period,
    finding an increase of 15% (15,000 km<sup>2</sup>) in irrigated area in our study region. We found
    notable decreases in irrigated area in developing urban areas and in the southern Central
    Valley of California and increases in the plains of eastern Colorado, the Columbia River
    Basin, the Snake River Plain, and northern California."

    "Drought is one of the most ecologically and economically devastating natural phenomena affecting 
    the United States, causing the U.S. economy billions of dollars in damage, and driving widespread 
    degradation of ecosystem health. Many drought indices are implemented to monitor the current
    extent and status of drought so stakeholders such as farmers and local governments can 
    appropriately respond. Methods to forecast drought conditions weeks to months in advance are 
    less common but would provide a more effective early warning system to enhance drought response,
    mitigation, and adaptation planning. To resolve this issue, we introduce DroughtCast, a machine
    learning framework for forecasting the United States Drought Monitor (USDM). DroughtCast
    operates on the knowledge that recent anomalies in hydrology and meteorology drive future
    changes in drought conditions. We use simulated meteorology and satellite observed soil
    moisture as inputs into a recurrent neural network to accurately forecast the USDM between
    1 and 12 weeks into the future. Our analysis shows that precipitation, soil moisture, and
    temperature are the most important input variables when forecasting future drought
    conditions. Additionally, a case study of the 2017 Northern Plains Flash Drought shows
    that DroughtCast was able to forecast a very extreme drought event up to 12 weeks before
    its onset. Given the favorable forecasting skill of the model, DroughtCast may provide
    a promising tool for land managers and local governments in preparing for and mitigating
    the effects of drought."

    "Forests are subject to a range of management practices but it is unclear which produce 
    the most rapid rates of regrowth across heterogeneous moisture gradients produced by regional 
    climate and complex terrain. We analyzed recovery rates of satellite derived net primary productivity 
    (NPP) over 27 years for 26,069 individual silvicultural treatments (stands) across the western U.S. 
    at a 30 m resolution. Rates of NPP recovery and forest regrowth were on average 116% higher in wet 
    landscapes with lower annual climatic water deficits (8.59 ± 5.07 gC m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-2</sup>, 
    median ± inter-quartile range) when compared to dry landscapes (3.97 ± 2.67 gC m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-2</sup>). 
    This extensive spatial analysis indicates that hydroclimate is a dominant driver of forest regrowth and that 
    responses can be highly nonlinear depending upon local climate conditions. Differences in silvicultural 
    treatment also strongly controlled rates of regrowth within hydroclimatic settings; microclimates produced
    by shelterwood treatments maximized regrowth in dry landscapes whereas regrowth following clearcutting was 
    among the fastest in wet landscapes due to enhanced energy availability. Conversely, commercial thinning 
    regrowth rates were insensitive to hydroclimate and relatively consistent across the western U.S. Planting 
    had a differential effect on forest structure and rates of regrowth across hydroclimate with negative effects 
    in wet environments and positive effects in dry environments. In aggregate, this study provides a novel remote 
    sensing approach for characterizing forest regrowth dynamics across climatic gradients and the common 
    treatment options employed."

    "Growing demand for water resources coupled with climate-driven water scarcity and variability present critical 
    challenges to agriculture in the Western US. Despite extensive resources allocated to downscaling climate projections 
    and advances in understanding past, current, and future climatic conditions, climate information is underutilized in 
    decisions made by agricultural producers. Climate information providers need to understand why this information is 
    underutilized and what would better meet the needs of producers. To better understand how agricultural producers perceive 
    and utilize climate information, we conducted five focus groups with farmers and ranchers across Montana. Focus groups 
    revealed that there are fundamental scalar issues (spatial and temporal) that make climate information challenging for 
    producers to use. While climate information is typically produced at regional, national, or global spatial scales and at a 
    seasonal and mid- to end-of-century temporal scales, producers indicated that decision-making takes place at multiple 
    intermediate and small temporal and spatial scales. In addition, producers described other drivers of decision-making 
    that have little to do with climate information itself, but rather aspects of source credibility, past experience, trust 
    in information, and the politics of climate change. Through engaging directly with end-users, climate information providers 
    can better understand the spatial and temporal scales that align with different types of agricultural producers and decisions, 
    as well as the limitations of information provision given the complexity of the decision context. Increased engagement between 
    climate information providers and end-users can also address the important tradeoffs that exist between scale and uncertainty."

    "The 2017 flash drought arrived without early warning and devastated the U.S. northern Great Plains region comprising Montana, 
    North Dakota, and South Dakota and the adjacent Canadian Prairies. The drought led to agricultural production losses exceeding 
    $2.6 billion in the United States, widespread wildfires, poor air quality, damaged ecosystems, and degraded mental health. These 
    effects motivated a multiagency collaboration among academic, tribal, state, and federal partners to evaluate drought early 
    warning systems, coordination efforts, communication, and management practices with the goal of improving resilience and response 
    to future droughts. This essay provides an overview on the causes, predictability, and historical context of the drought, the 
    impacts of the drought, opportunities for drought early warning, and an inventory of lessons learned. Key lessons learned include 
    the following: 1) building partnerships during nondrought periods helps ensure that proper relationships are in place for a 
    coordinated and effective drought response; 2) drought information providers must improve their understanding of the annual decision 
    cycles of all relevant sectors, including, and beyond, direct impacts in agricultural sectors; and 3) ongoing monitoring of 
    environmental conditions is vital to drought early warning, given that seasonal forecasts lack skill over the northern Great Plains."

    "Here we use Richards Equation models of variably saturated soil and bedrock groundwater flow to investigate first-order patterns 
    of the coupling between soil and bedrock flow systems. We utilize a Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis to identify important hillslope 
    parameters controlling bedrock recharge and then model the transient response of bedrock and soil flow to seasonal precipitation. 
    Our results suggest that hillslopes can be divided into three conceptual zones of groundwater interaction, (a) the zone of lateral 
    unsaturated soil moisture accumulation (upper portion of hillslope), (b) the zone of soil saturation and bedrock recharge (middle 
    of hillslope) and (c) the zone of saturated-soil lateral flow and bedrock groundwater exfiltration (bottom of hillslope). Zones of 
    groundwater interaction expand upslope during periods of precipitation and drain downslope during dry periods. The amount of water 
    partitioned to the bedrock groundwater system a can be predicted by the ratio of bedrock to soil saturated hydraulic conductivity 
    across a variety of hillslope configurations. Our modelled processes are qualitatively consistent with observations of shallow 
    subsurface saturation and groundwater fluctuation on hillslopes studied in our two experimental watersheds and support a conceptual 
    model of tightly coupled shallow and deep subsurface circulation where groundwater recharge and discharge continuously stores and 
    releases water from longer residence time storage."

    "It has been suggested that hillslope topography can produce hydrologic refugia, sites where ecosystem productivity is relatively 
    insensitive to climate variation. However, the ecological impacts and spatial distribution of these sites are poorly resolved across 
    gradients in climate. We quantified the response of ecosystem net primary productivity to changes in the annual climatic water balance 
    for 30 years using pixel-specific linear regression (30-m resolution) across the western United States. The standardized slopes of 
    these models represent ecosystem climate sensitivity and provide a means to identify drought-resistant ecosystems. Productive and 
    resistant ecosystems were most frequent in convergent hillslope positions, especially in semiarid climates. Ecosystems in divergent 
    positions were moderately resistant to climate variability, but less productive relative to convergent positions. This topographic effect 
    was significantly dampened in hygric and xeric climates. In aggregate, spatial patterns of ecosystem sensitivity can be implemented for 
    regional planning to maximize conservation in landscapes more resistant to perturbations."

    "Patterns of energy and available moisture can vary over small (<1 km) distances in mountainous terrain. Information on fuel and soil 
    moisture conditions that resolves this variation could help to inform fire and drought management decisions. Here, we describe the development 
    of TOPOFIRE, a web-based mapping system designed to provide finely resolved information on soil water balance, drought, and wildfire danger 
    information for the contiguous United States. We developed 8-arc-second-resolution (~250 meter) daily historical, near real-time, and 4-day 
    forecast radiation, temperature, humidity, and snow water equivalent data and used these grids to calculate a suite of drought and wildfire 
    danger indices. Large differences in shortwave radiation and surface air temperature with aspect contribute to greater snow accumulation and 
    delays in melt timing on north-facing slopes, delaying fuel conditioning on shaded slopes. These datasets will help advance our understanding 
    of the role of topography in wildland fire spread and ecological effects. Integration with national programs like the Wildland Fire Assessment 
    System, the Wildland Fire Decision Support System, and drought early warning systems could support more proactive management of wildland fires 
    and refine the characterization of drought in mountainous regions of the United States."
