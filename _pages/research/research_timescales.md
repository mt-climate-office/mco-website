# Drought assessment has been outpaced by climate change: empirical arguments for a paradigm shift
A brief description. 

{% include image.html url="assets/images/timescales_1.png" description="Figure 1: Conceptual model describing the drought metric bias associated with a non-stationary climate scenario A theoretical accumulated precipitation dataset is presented on the horizontal axis, while the associated probability density function (PDF) is on the vertical axis. [left] Conceptual model showing one way that probability distributions can shift in time when conditions transition from a wetter, less variable state to a drier, more variable state. [right] Demonstration of how this shift can produce both a dry bias during dry times and a wet bias during wet times for a theoretical distribution." %}

Horizontal lines represent values computed using the temporally integrated distribution. [right] Probability density functions (PDFs) for each of the 30-year moving windows. The color scale represents the 30-year moving windowâ€™s final year and the black and white dashed line represents the temporally integrated PDF." %}
