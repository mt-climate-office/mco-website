# Use the Mesonet Dashboard
The [Montana Mesonet Dashboard](https://mesonet.climate.umt.edu/dash/) is a free, open source tool for plotting and analyzing the latest data from Montana Mesonet stations. The dashboard uses the [Plotly Dash](https://plotly.com/dash) library to create interactive graphs on demand, displaying up to two weeks of data for a given mesonet station. The dashboard also allows users to compare station data to 30-year [gridMET](https://www.climatologylab.org/gridmet.html) climate normals, download data, view derived agricultural metrics, and plot relevant satellite indicies against station data. For the full functionality of the dashboard, it is recommended to visit from a computer, but a mobile version with fewer features is also available. The code used to create the dashboard is publicly available at [https://github.com/mt-climate-office/mesonet-dashboard](https://github.com/mt-climate-office/mesonet-dashboard). If you encounter any bugs, would like to request a new feature, or have a question regarding the dashboard, please:

# A Cooperative Framework
No one entity can ensure sustained operation and success of a statewide climate and soil moisture information network. With this in mind, the MCO embraces a cooperative context that addresses a diverse set of information needs. The MCO extends a significant cost reduction on science grade stations to cooperators and installs them as funds become available. The MCO continues to develop to ensure that data are quality controlled and accessible in real time through web services and smart devices. An annual service fee covers data transmission fees, computing infrastructure, and maintenance costs. Simply stated, the MCO will not profit from the stations or maintenance of the network beyond the inherent value in facilitating an expansive and publically available soil moisture and climate information network for Montanans.

# Data Management
All stations are solar powered, and allow users to check the data from virtually anywhere in the world. Data are transmitted from the data-logger’s internal module to MCO’s secure server via cellular communication. Quality assurance and control checks are applied and the data are available to the user to access and monitor. Transmitted data are backed up in the data-logger’s memory and at the MCO to provide an extra layer of redundancy and protection.

# Background
The Montana Climate Office (MCO) installed 6 weather and soil moisture monitoring stations in 2016 as part of the Montana Research and Economic Development Initiative (MREDI). The Mesonet was designed to support decision-making for statewide drought assessments, precision agriculture and rangeland and forested watershed management. Since 2016 the network has grown to over 100 stations through support from private landowners, watershed groups, tribes, state agencies and grants from federal entities. In 2020 the MCO was awarded a contract from the U.S. Army Corps to add 205 additional stations. The new stations will be installed every 500 square miles in central and eastern Montana to improve drought assessments and flood forecasting - in the protection of lives and property.
