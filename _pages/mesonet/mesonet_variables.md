# Variables Measured at Montana Mesonet Stations

Below is a list of all variables measured at Montana Mesonet stations. Variables measured differ between the AgriMet and HydroMet. To see exactly which variables are measured at a given station, visit the `elements` endpoint of our API for a given station (e.g. [https://mesonet.climate.umt.edu/api/elements/acebozem](https://mesonet.climate.umt.edu/api/elements/acebozem))

| Variable | Description | Reported Units |
|----------|-------------|-------|
|Air Temperature|The air temperature measured at 2 meters above the ground (for the HydroMet; 2.44 meters for the AgriMet)|degF|
|Atmospheric Pressure|The atmospheric pressure measured at the station|millibar|
|Precipitation|The total precipitation recorded since the last report|inches|
|Precipitation Max Rate|The maximum rate of precipitation since the last report|inches hr^-1|
|Relative Humidity|The relative humidity of the air|%|
|Soil Bulk EC|The electrical conductivity of the soil at a given depth|mS cm^-1|
|Soil VWC|The volumetric water content of the soil at a given depth|%|
|Soil Temperature|The temperature of the soil at a given depth|degF|
|Snow Depth|The depth of the snow on the ground|inches|
|Solar Radiation|The strength of incoming solar radiation|W m^-2|
|Well Water Level|The depth of the groundwater well|inches|
|Well EC|The electrical conductivity of the groundwater well at a given depth.|mS cm^-1|
|Wind Gust Speed| The maximum wind speed observed over a reporting interval (5-minute interval for the HydroMet, 15-minute interval for the AgriMet)|mi hr^-1|
|Wind Speed|The average wind speed since the last report|mi hr^-1|
|Wind Direction|The average wind direction since the last report|arcdeg|
