The Montana Climate Office collaborates with a number of partners across the country to produce research and data products for the general public. Existing projects are available on the sidebar to the left, and upcoming projects are listed below:

* Climate Data Explorer: An online tool to easily analyze climatic trends across the state. This explorer will allow users to evaluate how temperature, precipitation and vegitation is changing across the state. 
* Derived Metrics Dashboard: An addition to the Montana Mesonet Dashboard that displays metrics derived from weather station data such as growing degree days, last freeze date, etc.
* Soil Water Retention: Soil samples from Montana Mesonet stations are currently being processed. Once complete, these soil samples will be used in conjunction with Mesonet soil moisture data to provide metrics such as wilting point and relative soil saturation.
