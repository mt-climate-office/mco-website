The Montana Climate Office has worked with various groups across the state to produce and distiribute climate information about the state of Montana. The MCO produces updated and downscaled projections of climate change in MT as well as analysis of historical trends. As models of climate change improve over time, we update these analyses to provide the most current data. The best way to explore these historical and projected changes in climate is with the 'Climate Data Explorer', a tool for visualizing historical and future climate projections of Montana. A snapshot of the explorer is visible below. Click the image to use the tool!
