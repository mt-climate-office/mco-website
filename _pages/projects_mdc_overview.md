# Project Overview
## Objectives
* Transform existing forecasts and projections into innovative and relevant climate information that **meets producer needs** and **communicates relevant details** in compelling and useful formats.
* Develop a detailed understanding of **how this information is utilized in producer decisions** about water use and conservation, and adaptation to drought and variability.
* Compare the **efficacy of different communication strategies and media**, the perceptions and decisions of different types of producers, and the **barriers** and **constraints** to adoption of water conservation behaviors.
* Institutionalize long-term programs that provide relevant, adaptable climate information, with **mechanisms for regular feedback** from producers.

## Approach

## Impact
* Improve adaptation to both drought and water variability
* Sustain agricultural livelihoods
* Revitalize rural communities
* Advance food security
* Maintain ecosystem services

This research will provide guidance for **best practices** for delivering climate information to agricultural producers throughout the US, and will have a **transformative and lasting impact** on the ways that producers use water and how they plan for drought and water variability. This project has the potential to make important contributions to the social science literature on **climate information and decision-making**, especially in agricultural contexts.

## Timeline
* **Year 1**: Develop newsletter and web prototypes, conduct focus groups and analyze data, revise climate information, develop sample for experiment, develop manuscript on focus group results.

* **Year 2â€“3**: Produce quarterly climate information, conduct panel study.

* **Year 4**: Conduct survey and analyze data, convene stakeholders, conduct interviews and analyze data, convene stakeholders to develop plan to institutionalize findings, develop manuscripts.
