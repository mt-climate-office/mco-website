# Native Climate
Our collaborative team of researchers, Tribal Extension educators, and Climate Hub leaders will expand USDA Climate Hub capacity and serve as a “climate clearinghouse” of tools and technologies to support climate resilience planning and actions by tribal agriculture producers in the Intermountain West. The Native Climate project aims to enhance Native agroecosystem resilience by expanding climate services and outreach to Tribal Extension agents, agriculture producers, and youth educators in the Southwest and Northern Plains regions. Native Climate activities are designed to foster trust between Climate Hubs and Native farmers, ranchers, and resource managers in their regions through respectful, equitable, and culturally-appropriate information sharing. Equally important, these activities aim to foster trust in Indigenous climate adaptation knowledge and methods among western scientists and climate service providers. Native Climate will support a cadre of Native Climate Fellows to work directly with SW/NP Hubs coordinating climate data needs, extending outreach to ag-producers, and sharing youth climate education materials, and create student internships for Native Climate Reporters to spotlight climate impacts and adaptation by tribes in the region. The Native Climate Toolkit will support a web-based interactive resource clearinghouse and impact reporting and alert tools. The Native Climate Advisory Group will help the team engage tribes in the region, leverage resources from partner organizations, and conduct culturally-respectful project evaluation. Building responsive and respectful communications with tribal partners, while acknowledging historical injustices to Native Americans and value the wisdom of Native traditions and practices, will be one step towards mitigating climate injustice in Indian Country.
