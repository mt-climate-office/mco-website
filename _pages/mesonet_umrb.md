# U.S. Army Corps UMRB Project
In 2020 the MCO was awarded a contract from the U.S. Army Corps to add 205 additional stations. The new stations will be installed every 500 square miles in central and eastern Montana to improve drought assessments and flood forecasting - in the protection of lives and property. Below is a map of the project's status.
