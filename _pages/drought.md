The Montana Climate Office collaborates with NOAAâ€™s National Integrated Drought Information System, the MT Governor's Drought and Water Supply Committee and the MT Department of Natural Resources and Conservation  to derive current drought metrics across the Upper Missouri River Basin. The metrics are available on the [Drought Dashboard](https://drought.climate.umt.edu), which allows users to interact with and explore current drought conditions across the region:
