# Support Us
The Montana Climate Office is an independent state-designated body that provides Montanans with high-quality, timely, relevant, and scientifically based climate information and services. We operate on soft money funds achieved through grants, individual projects and commitments of our own personal time. If you appreciate our services, please consider a donation to help us keep the doors open and to navigate the waters ahead.
