# Visualize Weather Data
The [Montana Mesonet Dashboard](https://mesonet.climate.umt.edu/dash/) is a free, open source tool for plotting and analyzing the latest data from Montana Mesonet stations. The dashboard uses the [Plotly Dash](https://plotly.com/dash) library to create interactive graphs on demand, displaying up to two weeks of data for a given mesonet station. The dashboard also allows users to compare station data to 30-year [gridMET](https://www.climatologylab.org/gridmet.html) climate normals and plot relevant satellite indicies against station data. The code used to create the dashboard is publicly available at [https://github.com/mt-climate-office/mesonet-dashboard/tree/develop](https://github.com/mt-climate-office/mesonet-dashboard/tree/develop).
