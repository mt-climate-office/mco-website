<h1 style="text-align: center;">Explore the Mesonet</h1>
The Montana Mesonet is a network of over 100 weather, soil moisture and snow monitoring stations that the MCO operates across Montana. The stations measure a variety of meteorological variables including air temperature, relative humidity, soil moisture, and precipitation. **Click** on a station on the adjacent map to access station data and view station metadata, or visit the [Mesonet Dashboard](https://mesonet.climate.umt.edu/dash/). To learn more about the mesonet, visit the [Montana Mesonet](/mesonet/) tab.

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Analyze Drought Conditions</h1>
The Montana Climate Office produces daily models of drought conditions for the Upper Missouri River Basin (UMRB), Washington, Oregon and Idaho to help state and local governments make timely and informed decisions about drought. Popular drought indices and satellite variables for soil moisture and vegetation health are derived daily across the domain.
